# OpenSCAD designs, for 3D printing, etc.

## File formats and extensions

All OpenSCAD source files have a '.scad' extension. All corresponding print-ready
files have a '.stl' extension, and are published to [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/syncom/openscad-designs/releases/tag/stl). 

# OpenSCAD design tools and STL viewing

I use the modeler provided at the [OpenSCAD
website](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) to program, render, and export
3D designs.

STL files can be viewed in software such as [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net).

# 3D printing

I have tried Makerbot Replicator+, available at a public library near me, and
Flashforge Adventurer 3. I've used them to print out my designs. I have only
tried PLA and ABS.

My default printer set-up for Makerbot Replicator+ is:

- Infill: 20%
- Shell: 2
- Travel rate: 140 mm/s
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Temperature: 215 C
- Bed temperature: 65 C
