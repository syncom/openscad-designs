# OpenSCAD designs, for 3D printing, etc.

## File formats and extensions

All OpenSCAD source files have a '.scad' extension. All print-ready files 
have a '.stl' extension. All rendered images have a '.png' extension.

# OpenSCAD design tools

I use the modeller provided at the [OpenSCAD
website](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) to program, render, and
export 3D designs.

# 3D printing

I have only tried Makebot Replicator+, available at a public library near me,
to print out my designs. I have only tried PLA, and do NOT have any experience
with ABS. My default printer set-up is:

- Infill: 20%
- Shell: 2
- Travel rate: 140 mm/s
- Layer height: 0.2mm
- Temperature: 215 C
- Bed temperature: 65 C
